<p class="Pp"><i class="Em"> (If you read this in a browser, this is an HTML
    version of</i> <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> <i class="Em"> 's</i>
    <i class="Em"> intro manpage. Links to system manual pages will not
    work).</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> is a thin layer between
    <a class="Xr" href="dh_make.1.html">dh_make(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder(8)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="apt-ftparchive.1.html">apt-ftparchive(1)</a> to allow
    creating and building minimally viable Debian packages, without the usual
    paperwork and directory dance that comes with the official method. It also
    maintains a local (file:///) repository to install packages easily. Only
    Debian Sid (unstable) is supported.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> totally integrates itself
    inside the Debian packages management system, and does not need a bootstrap,
    just some Debian packages installed and the swirlbuild tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is heavily influenced by OpenBSD's ports collection, while some
    hints were taken from Alpine's Abuild and CRUX's ports.</p>
<p class="Pp">The heavy lifting is done by:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="Xr" href="dh_make.1.html">dh_make(1)</a></dt>
  <dd>creates all the necessary paperwork needed to reduce ours.</dd>
  <dt><a class="Xr" href="pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder(8)</a></dt>
  <dd>build packages in a chroot; when building with
      <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>, no development packages will be
      installed on your system.</dd>
  <dt><a class="Xr" href="you.4.html">you(4)</a></dt>
  <dd>While <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> simplifies a lot the creation of
      Debian packages, you will still have to do some work. If you do not feel
      confortable with that, you may have a look at
      <a class="Lk" href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">the effing
      package management (fpm)</a> , that is easier but less flexible out of the
      box.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">See <a class="Sx" href="#MOTIVATIONS">MOTIVATIONS</a> on why I
    ended up creating this, and <a class="Sx" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a>
    because it is a rudimentary system, and may not fit your use case.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SWIRL_?"><a class="permalink" href="#SWIRL_?">SWIRL?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">SWIRL means <b>S</b>oft<b>W</b>are <b>I</b>n Ou<b>R</b>

    <a class="Sx" href="#MOTIVATIONS">MOTIVATIONS</a>.
    <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> is not a Debian-backed software, and is
    totally unofficial.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because &quot;ports&quot; means something else in
    <a class="Lk" href="https://www.debian.org/ports/index.en.html">Debian's
    jargon</a> than the usual BSD meaning of &quot;ports&quot;, the recipe to

<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> needs
    <a class="Xr" href="sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> and your current user must be
    able to use it to be root at least for running

<h2 class="Ss" id="Deployment"><a class="permalink" href="#Deployment">Deployment</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You usually do this once by machine.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assuming you have downloaded <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> in
    your home directory:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>$ cd swirlbuild
$ ./infrastructure/bin/deploy builder</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There you will be asked to validate the installation of some
    packages, sadly it is always too many but it is not our fault ;) An empty
    repository will be created in
    <span class="Pa">~/swirlbuild/repository</span> and an entry in
    <span class="Pa">/etc/apt/sources.list.d</span> will be added for it. Also a
    <a class="Xr" href="pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder(8)</a> base chroot will be
    created.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Building_your_first_swirl"><a class="permalink" href="#Building_your_first_swirl">Building
  your first swirl</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">First thing first: you should ALWAYS ensure that your system is up
    to date before running
    <a class="Xr" href="buildswirl.1.html">buildswirl(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">We will start with <span class="Pa">swirls/oksh</span> because it
    is simple; it is the OpenBSD version of the Korn Shell. Do not move from
    your ~/swirlbuild directory and run this:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>$ sudo apt update</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you have a recently installed Debian Sid,
    <a class="Xr" href="apt.8.html">apt(8)</a> will complain about permissions.
    It is because Debian made a change to $HOME permissions for newly created
    users. See
    <a class="Lk" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1014901">Debian
    bug report 1014901</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can ignore the warning,
    <a class="Xr" href="chmod.1.html">chmod(1)</a> 0755 your $HOME, and many
    more options. Let's continue to the installation and the test of that oksh
    swirl:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>$ sudo apt upgrade
$ ./buildswirl swirls/oksh</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You will be met by a wall of text. Your password may be asked by
    <a class="Xr" href="sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> for
    <a class="Xr" href="pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder(8)</a> use. Grab a coffee/tea
    and/or feel yourself like a hacker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hopefully the build has ended. <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>
    never installs packages by itself.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>$ sudo apt install oksh
$ oksh
oksh&gt; echo $OKSH_VERSION
7.2
oksh&gt; exit
$ sudo apt remove oksh</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The documentation for
    <a class="Xr" href="buildswirl.1.html">buildswirl(1)</a>, and the whole
    <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> system can be installed on your system
    just like this:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>$ cd ${HOME}/swirlbuild &amp;&amp; ./buildswirl swirls/swirlbuild-docs</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">HTML versions of the manpages are also available in
    <span class="Pa">/usr/share/doc/swirlbuild-docs/html</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Through the documentation, you may see references to
    <span class="Pa">$SWIRLBUILD</span>, which has to be replaced by where you
    have put the <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> tree on your computer.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USING_THE_REPOSITORY_ON_OTHER_MACHINES"><a class="permalink" href="#USING_THE_REPOSITORY_ON_OTHER_MACHINES">USING
  THE REPOSITORY ON OTHER MACHINES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are many ways to deploy <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>
    across the network. We will take something you have already probably
    experienced for that: <a class="Xr" href="rsync.1.html">rsync(1)</a> coupled
    with <a class="Xr" href="ssh.1.html">ssh(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Let's say we have a <var class="Va">desktop</var> machine, where
    you have built some packages, and you want them to be installed on the
    <var class="Va">laptop</var> machine.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is implied that the two machines have the same architecture,
    see <a class="Sx" href="#Multi_Architecture">Multi Architecture</a> about
    why. First we will copy swirlbuild from <var class="Va">desktop</var> to
    <var class="Va">laptop</var>:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>laptop$ cd; rsync -av --delete -e ssh desktop:~/swirlbuild .</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Then we deploy <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> as a
    &quot;user&quot;. Note that you can totally &quot;upgrade&quot; later to
    &quot;builder&quot; by running the script again.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>laptop$ cd swirlbuild &amp;&amp; ./infrastructure/bin/deploy user</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">As you have noticed, this only adds an
    <span class="Pa">/etc/apt/sources.list.d</span> entry for your repository.
    Now it is the same thing as the <var class="Va">desktop</var> machine:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>laptop$ sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade; sudo apt install oksh; oksh</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There are other ways indeed, like using a webserver for example,
    but that is up to you.</p>

    &quot;USUAL WORKFLOW&quot;, where I describe the creation of the
    <span class="Pa">unmaintained-swirls/badwolf</span> swirl.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is recommended to build a basic Debian package before starting,
    see <a class="Lk" href="https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro">the

<p class="Pp">Veracrypt :) As you probably know, Veracrypt will never be
    included in Debian, unless there is a radical license change. There is a
    whole story behind on how it snowballed to this project, but it is not
    interesting in a technical document.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other reason why I wanted this is avoiding appimages, snaps,
    flatpaks for software not included in Debian (for various reasons).</p>
<p class="Pp">I looked around, and did not like the other solutions. I am a
    former OpenBSD user and wanted a small ports tree back, while keeping
    Debian.</p>
<p class="Pp">I have a script that rsync(1) my desktop PC home directory from my
    laptops one, and then do the apt(1) upgrade thing. This explains why
    <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> has been made this way and not meant as a
    &quot;system&quot; package building system.</p>
<p class="Pp">I do not expect anyone but me using it, but documenting it like I
    would has been an amazing

  <li><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> is a solo work, and as I am writing
      this, I am its only user. You may use it in a way I did not planned and
      meet a bug. Features have been heavily tested as they have been
      implemented, but many are barely used as well.</li>
  <li><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> only supports Debian unstable.
      Supporting stable is more complicated than changing a few hardcoded values
      here and there. Think about backports being present or not, the security
      repository situation, and probably more things.
    <p class="Pp">Debian Testing with pinning *may* work, but there is no
        guarantee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>While C and C++ are fully supported, other programming languages may
      require more work on your part, especially if an external module is not
      available as a package.
    <p class="Pp">Golang and Python are usually well supported and examples are
        provided in <span class="Pa">unmaintained-swirls</span>. Rust status is
        well ... you can do it, but
        <a class="Xr" href="debcargo.1.html">debcargo(1)</a> is probably a
        better option.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> does not support multipackages
      (-dev/-doc/-bin). I do not like this feature in Debian, excepted for debug
      symbols that <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> provides by the way. The
      same can be said about Suggests and Recommends. Also implementing them
      does not play well with <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> &#x00B4;s goals
      to stay simple.</li>
  <li><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> uses a networked version of
      <a class="Xr" href="pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder(8)</a>. This is intended
      mostly for golang and rust packages, to avoid packaging too many
      crates/modules.</li>
  <li><code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> features an almost fully staged build
      process, but is split between <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> stages
