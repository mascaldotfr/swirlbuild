<p class="Pp">This manual includes all informations to create and maintain a
    swirl, as well as details about <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>. It tries
    to be exhaustive, but cannot replace practice and analysis of already
    existing swirls.</p>
<p class="Pp">Looking at <span class="Pa">swirls/oksh</span> is a good point to
    get started. <a class="Sx" href="#USUAL_WORKFLOW">USUAL WORKFLOW</a>
    describes a typical workflow when creating a swirl, with a real-life
    example.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to build a swirl as a simple user, please read
    <a class="Xr" href="buildswirl.1.html">buildswirl(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The general idea of <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> is to give
    you a lot of freedom to turn around its limitations. It will not stop you
    from doing stupid things, not many checks are done.</p>
<p class="Pp"><var class="Va">$SWIRLBUILD</var> is used in this documentation to
    represent the root directory of <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>, where
    the <a class="Xr" href="buildswirl.1.html">buildswirl(1)</a> script can be
    found.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUILDFILES"><a class="permalink" href="#BUILDFILES">BUILDFILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Buildfiles, known as
    <span class="Pa">swirls/&lt;swirlname&gt;/build</span> are simple shell
    scripts sourced by <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>. As such, standard
    shell conventions apply when it comes to quoting, and all our usual shell
    utilities can be used inside of it.
    <a class="Xr" href="dash.1.html">dash(1)</a> as
    <span class="Pa">/bin/sh</span> is implied. Note that using utilities out of
    the Debian base utilities and packages pulled during the deployment of
    <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> should be avoided, and otherwise
    safeguards should be added to tell the user to install said utilities.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's recommended to use the same ordering used in
    <span class="Pa">$SWIRLBUILD/build.template</span>.</p>

    <p class="Pp">(facultative) Epoch number of the swirl. Its value is 0 by
        default and is implied if not added to the buildfile. If it appears that

        <a class="Xr" href="dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a> does not see the new

    <p class="Pp">(mandatory) The license file(s) that can be found in upstream
        tarball. These are relative to the root of the sources or absolute,
        separated by space(s). If files have spaces or special characters, you
        should quote them. They are concatenated with one blank line between
        each others in <span class="Pa">debian/copyright</span>. If the files
        mentioned in LICENSE are non-existant
        <a class="Xr" href="buildswirl.1.html">buildswirl(1)</a> will immediatly

    <p class="Pp">(facultative) By default, <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code>
        will use a number of build jobs that is equal to the
        <a class="Xr" href="nproc.1.html">nproc(1)</a> output. Sometimes this is
        not adequate, for example if the software you are building does not
        support parallel processing or takes too much memory. MAKE_JOBS defines
        the number of parallel jobs during different steps of the build. By
        convention, if some software needs 4GB of RAM or more by job
        consistently put <var class="Va">MAKE_JOBS=1</var>.</p>

        be in the <var class="Va">{PKGNAME}-{VERSION}</var> format. If it is not

    <p class="Pp">The generated Debian package name. It is discouraged to clash
        your package name with Debian, if needed add a suffix, for example vim

  DEBUG VARIABLES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are meant to be used not only when you create a swirl. Final
    users can also make use of them as environment variables. It is recommended
    to keep them around in the build file until you have finished your work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is the list of available debug variables:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="DEBUG_SOURCE"><a class="permalink" href="#DEBUG_SOURCE"><code class="Ev">DEBUG_SOURCE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">If you define DEBUG_SOURCE, the build will stop before
        building the binary package and open a shell, where you can debug issues
        in your patches, <span class="Pa">debian/</span> files and so on. As
        soon as the shell is exited, the temporary directory is removed. That is
        necessary if you need to add a patch to your swirl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">At this stage the source tarball than
        <a class="Xr" href="pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder(8)</a> will use is already
        generated as you can see if you enter the debug source shell. The
        <code class="Ev">SWIRLDIR</code> environment variable is set and points
        to the current swirl directory.</p>

    will override what <a class="Xr" href="dh_make.1.html">dh_make(1)</a>
  did.</p>
<p class="Pp"><a class="Lk" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.en.html">The
    Debian Maintainer Guide</a> contains a lot of informations about what can be
    used to make your building process easier, simply by defining some files,
    like adding users, services, documentations etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">The whole <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> tree has many
    examples for these files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Try your best to use the &quot;facilities&quot; provided by this
    directory. Using them is more future proof than injecting a Makefile through
    <a class="Sx" href="#prebuild">prebuild</a>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Providing_a_license_in_the_package_is_mandatory"><a class="permalink" href="#Providing_a_license_in_the_package_is_mandatory">Providing
  a license in the package is mandatory</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is mandatory to include the software license, and/or the end
    user license agreement (EULA), and potentially other files required by
    upstream into the produced package if you intend to make your swirl public,
    and as such being used by third parties.</p>
<p class="Pp">As mentioned in the documentation for
    <a class="Sx" href="#LICENSE">LICENSE</a> this variable must point to valid
    license file(s). <code class="Nm">swirlbuild</code> does not include license
    markers to avoid misinterpretation of upstream licensing terms. Here are
    some special cases when upstream does not provide some valid license
    file(s). That list may grow over time.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The swirl is not distributed to the public: use simply
      <span class="Pa">/dev/null</span> in <code class="Ev">LICENSE</code>.</li>
  <li>In any other case, ask upstream to add a LICENSE file.
      <a class="Lk" href="https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/">This
      rationale</a> may convince them. Until a LICENSE file is provided, the
      swirl should stay private.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">This matters for users, in case they inavertendly distribute
    generated Debian packages to the general public, given that the full license
    text and the <a class="Sx" href="#SOURCE">SOURCE</a> URL are provided in
    <span class="Pa">/usr/share/doc/&lt;PKGNAME&gt;/copyright</span>, it
    respects said license conditions in many, but not all, cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">This matters for swirls creators, in case upstream's licensing
    file layout is not clear and the license is misrepresented in your swirl,
    then contested by upstream. Upstream got to do their homework and provide
    either a single license file or location including all the possible licences
    used in their software source code. Veracrypt and PPSSPP are good examples
    of that.</p>

    that these files are not automatically added to the build. Using the
